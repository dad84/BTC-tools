If each peer generates their own seed value and scans all the keys in that seed, and then shares the results with the network,
this could help distribute the work of scanning the key space across multiple peers and reduce the time it takes to find a match.

To implement this approach, each peer would generate their own seed value, scan all the keys in that seed,
and record the results (i.e., the private keys and addresses) in a local file. Once the scan is complete,
the peer would then broadcast the results to the network, along with their seed value, 
so that other peers can combine the results and continue the search.

Each peer would keep track of the seeds and indexes that have already been scanned to avoid duplicates.
When a new seed value is received from the network, 
a peer can check their local file to see if they already have the results for that seed.
If not, they can start scanning from the last index that was scanned and record the results in their local file.

One potential issue with this approach is that some peers may generate the same seed value and scan the same keys, 
resulting in duplicate work. To avoid this, you can use a random seed value generator and make sure that the probability of 
generating the same seed value is low. Alternatively, you can divide the key space into non-overlapping segments and assign 
each segment to a different peer to scan, so that there is no overlap in the work being done.

Overall, this approach can help distribute the work of scanning the key space and potentially reduce the time it takes to find a match
However, it also requires coordination and communication among the peers to ensure that the work is being done efficiently and
effectively.
