## Introduction
Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that allows for peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries such as banks. One of the key features of Bitcoin is its use of public-key cryptography to generate and verify transactions. In this post, we'll explore a Python script that generates Bitcoin addresses and searches for matches with a list of target addresses, while also implementing a basic blockchain with a mining algorithm.

# Script Overview
The btc.py script defines two classes: Block and Blockchain. The Block class represents a block in the blockchain and contains information such as the index, timestamp, keys (i.e., a list of generated Bitcoin addresses and their corresponding private keys), previous hash, and hash. The Blockchain class represents the blockchain and contains a list of blocks, a difficulty level, and methods for creating a genesis block, adding a new block to the chain, and checking the validity of the chain.

The script also defines a generate_key() function that generates a private key and corresponding Bitcoin address, and a binary_search() function that performs a binary search on a list of target addresses to find a match with a generated address.

The main() function of the script generates Bitcoin addresses and adds them to a list until the list reaches a size of 100,000, at which point a new block is created and added to the blockchain. The function then checks if the latest generated address matches any of the target addresses. If a match is found, the corresponding private key and address are saved to a text file and the program exits. Otherwise, the program continues generating addresses and adding them to the blockchain. Once the program exits, the blockchain is serialized to a JSON file.

# Address Generation
The generate_key() function uses the ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) library to generate a 256-bit private key. It then derives the corresponding public key and encodes it in compressed format. The public key is then hashed using SHA-256, and the result is hashed again using RIPEMD-160. The resulting hash is combined with a version byte (0x00 for mainnet) and a checksum to create a 25-byte payload. The payload is then encoded in base58 format using the base58.b58encode() function to create a Bitcoin address.

# Blockchain Implementation
The Blockchain class implements a simple blockchain with a mining algorithm. The create_genesis_block() method creates the first block in the chain with an index of 0, a timestamp of the current time, and an empty list of keys. The get_latest_block() method returns the last block in the chain. The add_block() method adds a new block to the chain by setting its previous hash to the hash of the last block, calculating its own hash, and appending itself to the chain. The is_valid() method checks the validity of the chain by iterating over each block and checking that its hash matches its calculated hash, and that its previous hash matches the hash of the previous block.

# Binary Search
The binary_search() function performs a binary search on a sorted list of target addresses to find a match with a generated address. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target address is found, or the search interval is empty.

# Conclusion
In this post, we explored a Python script that generates Bitcoin addresses and searches for matches with a list of target addresses, while also implementing a basic blockchain with a mining algorithm. While this script is not optimized for performance and should not be used for actual cryptocurrency mining or transactions, it provides a useful introduction to the key concepts and algorithms involved in Bitcoin address generation and blockchain implementation. With further optimization and additional functionality, this script could be used as the basis for more advanced Bitcoin address generation and blockchain applications.
